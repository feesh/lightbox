# ðŸ“¸ Gallery lightbox
An example gallery and lightbox using vanilla Javascript and Sass. This demo generates a gallery using the Flickr API, in particular their search query, to return a set of photos to display. Photos can be selected to view in lightbox mode, and you can navigate backwards and forwards through the set.

### ðŸ‘‰ Get started
Testing this out locally? This repo is based on the Yeoman Webapp boilerplate ([documentation here](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp/blob/master/docs/README.md)). Start here to get set up:
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies. Run `bower install` and `npm install`.
3. To preview and watch changes, run `gulp serve`.
4. To build for distribution, run `gulp`. Files will be packaged to the `/dist` folder.

(or) To view statically, open `dist/index.html` in a browser.

### ðŸŒŸ Features
- Loads a set of photos through Flickr search API.
- View an image larger by clicking on a thumbnail.
- Navigate to next and previous images in the set.

### ðŸš€ Future upgrades
Although this was a fun project to start on, given the time constraints there are definitely additional potential features I'd love to continue implementing, including:
- [x] Tests (also largely due to the no library constraint).
- [ ] Better error handling in case we get a set of images back, but the image server farms are down and no actual image is displayed.
- [ ] Improved animations, between opening the lightbox, and also when navigating.
- [x] Dynamic search, change the search query to load a new set.
- [ ] Lazy loading for images.
- [ ] Infinite scroll to continue pulling new pages of images.
- [ ] Dynamically set max-height or max-width for too-tall or too-wide photos.
- [ ] Set up masonry style for thumbnails.
